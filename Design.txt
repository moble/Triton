* Operate in place as often as possible

* Make the class definition clean; prefer free functions to member functions
** Maybe modify this when the goal is to SWIGify, because that's more pythonic

* Separate class definition header file from free functions (but use the same namespace)

* Provide access functions for each member datum
** non-const reference
** const reference

* Provide direct set-access functions (rather than returning references to object data) for SWIG
** Substitutes for the various +=, -=, *=, and /= operators
** Substitutes for the various cmath functions
** Possibly for_each similar to the one in stl's algorithms

* Do NOT try to co-locate c++ and python memory
** References are unmanaged and memory can get out of sync
** Crazy bugs arise otherwise, even when they shouldn't (e.g., just plotting doesn't work)
** Make things explicit (with explicit set methods, for example)
** Let std_vector.i do its work



* To do
** Convert Routines to python scripts
** Add Quaternion function of time to Waveform data
*** Check all member functions for the new 'frame' member data
**** Flux: check frame; if not constant, rotate before calculating
**** operator= : make sure the frame data is copied
**** operator/ : rotate into a common frame? or return W1.frame * W2.frame.Inverse() ?
*** New member functions:
**** PeakFluxTimeIndex
**** PeakFluxTime
**** WaveformInStationaryFrame
*** Add frame data to I/O
** Get h5 import working
** Handle errors so python doesn't just exit on a throw from c++
** Add directors to use for_each method on Waveforms with python-defined function
