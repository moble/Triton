* Operate in place as often as possible

* Make the class definition clean; prefer free functions to member functions

* Separate class definition header file from free functions (but use the same namespace)

* Provide access functions for each member datum
** non-const reference
** const reference

* Provide direct set-access functions (rather than returning references to object data) for SWIG
** Substitutes for the various +=, -=, *=, and /= operators
** Substitutes for the various cmath functions
** Possibly for_each similar to the one in stl's algorithms

* Do NOT try to co-locate c++ and python memory
** Crazy bugs arise otherwise, even when they shouldn't (e.g., just plotting doesn't work)
** Make things explicit (with explicit set methods, for example)
** References are unmanaged and memory can get out of sync
** Let std_vector.i do its work
*** Maybe add another step to convert to numpy arrays on output



* To do
** Get the Matrix return values working
** Add directors to use for_each method
** Add Quaternion function of time to Waveform data
** Move as many member functions to free functions as possible
** Move those free functions to separate header files
** Also do that for Waveforms, etc.
