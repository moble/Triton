## This file contains all the recognized options to the 'LMtoThetaPhi' routine.
## Currently, only one (theta,phi) point is accepted per run.
## Commented lines are optional, and contain the default values.
## In the directory with the data file, copy this input file, and edit as desired.
## Then use this with the command line
##    LMtoThetaPhi < LMtoThetaPhi.input |& tee LMtoThetaPhi.out
## (assuming that the LMtoThetaPhi routine is on your path).

## The data in LM format to read in
DataIn  = rPsi4_R100m_U8+.dat;

## The data file to be output
DataOut = rPsi4_R100m_Theta%0.4f_Phi%0.4f.dat;

## The usual polar angles at which to evaluate
#Theta = 0.0;
#Phi = 0.0;
