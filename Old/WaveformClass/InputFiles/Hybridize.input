## This file contains all the recognized options to the 'Hybridize' routine.
## Commented lines are optional, and contain the default values.  The required
## options are t1, t2, and tmerger, which delimit the matching/blending phase.
## In the directory with the data files, use this with the command line
##    Hybridize < Hybridize.input |& tee Hybridize.out
## (assuming that the Hybridize routine is on your path).

## The following are the physical parameters of the system
#delta = 0.0;  ## delta = (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2)
#chis = 0.0;  ## chis = (chi1 + chi2) / 2  [component along the Newtonian angular momentum]
#chia = 0.0;  ## chia = (chi1 - chi2) / 2  [component along the Newtonian angular momentum]
#v0 = 0.144; ## v0 = (Omega0)^(1/3).  For NINJA-2, Omega0 = 0.003, so v0=0.144.

## This is the approximant used to construct the PN waveform
#Approximant = TaylorT4;

## The NR data is read from this file
NRFile = rhOverM_ExtrapolatedN3.dat;
#Conjugate = false;
#ChangeToPsi4 = false;

## The hybrid is made by matching and blending between times t1 and t2
t1 = 500;
t2 = 2000;

## The PN needs to be offset roughly to the peak of the NR amplitude
tmerger = 3950;

## Ths following options allow certain modes to be dropped from the NR waveform before hybridization
#DropM0Modes = true; ## Drop all modes with m=0
#DropOddMModes = false; ## Drop all modes with odd m
#DropLs = ; ## This is a space-separated list of l modes to drop
#DropLMs = ; ## This is a space-separated list of l,m modes to drop (e.g., 8 2  8 -2  8 4  8 -4)
#DropAfter = 1e200;

## The final data is output to this file
#HybridFileName = Hybrid;
#DiffFileName = ;
#HybridDt = 0.0;
#NINJAFormat = false;
#MinimalGrid = false;
#AmpTol = 1.e-5;
#PhiTol = 1.e-5;
