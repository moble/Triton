## This file contains all the recognized options to the 'Hybridize' routine.
## Commented lines are optional, and contain the default values.  The required
## options are t1, t2, and tmerger, which delimit the matching/blending phase.
## In the directory with the data files, use this with the command line
##    PNComparison < PNComparison.input |& tee PNComparison.out
## (assuming that the Hybridize routine is on your path and that you use tcsh).

## The following are the physical parameters of the system
#delta = 0.0;  ## delta = (m1 - m2) / (m1 + m2)
#chis = 0.0;  ## chis = (chi1 + chi2) / 2  [component along the Newtonian angular momentum]
#chia = 0.0;  ## chia = (chi1 - chi2) / 2  [component along the Newtonian angular momentum]
#v0 = 0.144; ## v0 = (Omega0)^(1/3).  For NINJA-2, Omega0 = 0.003, so v0=0.144

## The NR data is read from this file
#NRFile = rhOverM_ExtrapolatedN5.dat; # relative path name
#Conjugate = false;
#ChangeToPsi4 = false;

## The hybrid is made by matching and blending between times t1 and t2
#omegaAlign = 0.0; ## If this is non-zero, align by matching at a particular frequency
t1 = 500;
t2 = 2000;

## The PN needs to be offset roughly to the peak of the NR amplitude
tmerger = 3950;

## Ths following options allow certain modes and times to be dropped from the NR waveform before hybridization
#DropM0Modes = false; ## Drop all modes with m=0
#DropOddMModes = false; ## Drop all modes with odd m
#DropNegativeMModes = false;
#DropLs = ; ## This is a space-separated list of l modes to drop
#DropLMs = ; ## This is a space-separated list of l,m modes to drop (e.g., 8 2  8 -2  8 4  8 -4)
#DropAfter = 1e200; ## This is the time after which data will be dropped.  You probably don't want to change this

## The difference data is output to "[NR.Type()]_[DiffFileNameBase]-[Approximant].dat"
#DiffFileNameBase = NR;
#UniformTime_Diff = -1; ## integer-valued; if >1, interpolate output Diff to 'UniformTime' uniform steps in time

## The hybrid data is output to "[NR.Type()]_[HybridFileNameBase]_[Approximant].dat"
#HybridFileNameBase = Hybrid;
#HybridDt = 0.0; # Time step to interpolate the hybrid to; 0 corresponds to no change
#MinimalGrid = false; # Prune unecessary data points (after HybridDt interpolation, if applicable)
#MagTol = 1.e-5; # Precision to which the final waveform
#ArgTol = 1.e-5; #   will be pruned if MinimalGrid is true
