## This file contains all the recognized options to the 'Flux' routine.
## All lines are optional, and contain the default values commented below.
## In the directory with the data files, use this with the command line
##    Flux < Flux.input |& tee Flux.out
## (assuming that the Flux routine is on your path).  There will be
## a set of files named FluxN*.dat output with columns of 
##    Time  -M*Omega(2,2)  Flux  PNFlux  Flux/PNFlux
## and a set of files named FluxConvergence_N[A]-N[B].dat with convergence
## tests in columns of
##    Time  -M*Omega(2,2)[A]  FluxA-FluxB  (FluxA-FluxB)/PNFluxA

## Assuming you want to compute flux for various extrapolation orders, 
## this is a space-separated list of those orders.
#ExtrapolationOrders = -1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8;

## This is the symmetric mass ratio nu = m1*m2/(m1+m2)^2 = q/(1+q)^2
MassRatio = <MassRatioGoesHere>;

## The following options are printf-formatted strings
#DataFiles = rhOverM_ExtrapolatedN%d.dat;       # Input data files
#FluxFiles = FluxN%d.dat;                       # Output flux files
#DifferenceFiles = FluxConvergence_N%d-N%d.dat; # Output convergence files

## These options allow the data to be trimmed, dropping early junk or
## late noise, for example.
#DropBefore = -3e300;
#DropAfter = 3e300;


### The following options are not yet re-implemented
# # ## Compute Omega using Savitzky-Golay smoothing and differentiation
# # #Smooth = false;
# # #SmoothingNLeft = 32;
# # #SmoothingNRight = 32;
# # #SmoothingPolyOrder = 4;
