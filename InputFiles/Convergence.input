## This file contains all the recognized options to the 'Convergence'
## routine.  All lines are optional, and contain the default values
## commented below.  It is recommended to make a separate directory
## (e.g., 'Convergence') near the extrapolation output directories,
## and run this from within that directory.  Use a command line like
##    Convergence < Convergence.input |& tee Convergence.out
## (assuming that the Convergence routine is on your path).


# FOR LEV CONVERGENCE:

## Space-separated list of relative directory names
LevList = <LevsGoHere>;
#LevList = ../Lev4 ../Lev5 ../Lev6;


# FOR EXTRAPOLATION CONVERGENCE:

## This is the directory in which the best extrapolated waves will be
## compared.  Note that you can also set this empty (equal to a
## semicolon) if you don't want to measure extrapolation convergence.
BestLev = <BestLevGoesHere>;
#BestLev = ../Lev6;


# FOR BOTH:

## The following are sprintf-formatted strings for the relevant file names.
## The '%d' will be replaced by the ExtrapolationOrders given below.
## An empty name skips that type of data
#Psi4Files = ;#rMPsi4_ExtrapolatedN%d.dat;  # Only include this if you have extrapolated Psi4
#RWZFiles  = rhOverM_ExtrapolatedN%d.dat;
#WaveformFormat = MagArg; # Format of the preceding data files (ReIm|MagArg)
#FluxFiles = ;#FluxN%d.dat;  # Only include this if you have run the Flux routine

## The list of extrapolation orders to compare
#ExtrapolationOrders = -1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8;

## This is the basic format for the convergence file names.  The data
## type will be prepended to this name.  Results will look like
## rMPsi4_Lev5-Lev4_N3.dat, rhOverM_Lev4-Lev3_N-1.dat,
## Flux_Lev6-Lev5_N2.dat, or rhOverM_N5-N4_Lev6.dat, for example.
#DifferenceFiles = %s-%s_%s.dat;
#ConvergenceAlignmentT1 = 3.0e300; ## Before doing convergence tests, align over this time range.
#ConvergenceAlignmentT2 = 3.0e300; ## Ranges with either end at 3.0e300 will not attempt to align

## If this is set to something greater than 0, all outputs will only
## contain (roughly) this many samples per cycle of the (2,2) mode.
#OutputNSamplesPerCycle22 = 0;

## If these are set to something other than the defaults, don't output
## data before or after (respectively) these numbers
#DropBefore = -3.0e300;
#DropAfter = 3.0e300;
